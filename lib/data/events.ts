    "This is more than paint on a wall. It is an act of healing, a process of transformation. 'Colors of Resilience' is an intensive 11-day initiative that partners world-renowned artists with local communities in Delhi to create murals that are monuments to their stories. We believe art is a catalyst for change—an alchemy that can turn fear into fearlessness, and silence into a voice. This project moves beyond mere aesthetics to ask a deeper question: Can we paint the world we want to live in?",

      "Enter a transcendent journey where ancient wisdom meets contemporary artistic vision. 'Myths We Inherit' is a groundbreaking exhibition that explores how mythological narratives, ancestral memories, and cultural symbols shape our contemporary identity. Curated by visionary Prachi Kapoor, this show brings together three powerful voices: Tirthraj Sinh Zala from Rajkot with his 'Neelantara: A Mythic Blue Journey' series, Abhishek Pandey from Pune exploring inherited myths through mixed media, and Farwa Moledina from Birmingham interpreting cultural symbolism through contemporary visual art. Zala's work specifically focuses on the cosmic power of blue, ritualistic mark-making, and symbols derived from Rajputana heritage, offering a deeply personal and evocative exploration of mythology that feels both timeless and entirely of the present.",

With a philosophy that art should transcend the confines of traditional galleries and collector storage units, she curates exhibitions that bring powerful voices together. Her curatorial approach focuses on creating space for meaningful artistic dialogue, as demonstrated in 'Myths We Inherit' where she brings together three distinct voices—each exploring myths, memories, and cultural symbols that shape identity.",
